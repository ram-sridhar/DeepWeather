Predicting weather by machine learning.

Machine learning is turning out to be a powerful learning technique across various domains today. This is a small attempt in applying machine learning in the field of meteorology. I have applied different methods to forecast various meterological variables. I hope some time in future machine learning techniques would be fully employed in weather forecasting.
