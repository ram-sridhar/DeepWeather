Predicting weather by machine learning.

Machine learning is turning out to be a powerful learning technique across various domains today. This is a small attempt in applying machine learning in the field of meteorology. I have applied different methods to forecast various meterological variables. I hope some time in future machine learning techniques would be fully employed in weather forecasting.

Some of the problems I have worked on include,

1. Identify the month by looking at the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) map.
2. Detecting the Madden-Julian Oscillation's (MJO) phase by using OLR and wind data.
3. Time series forecasting of MJO indexes.
4. Detecting the droughts by Nino index.

Many more to follow...
