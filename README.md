### Predicting weather by machine learning

Machine learning is turning out to be a powerful learning technique across various domains today. This is a small attempt in applying machine learning in the field of meteorology. I have applied different methods to forecast various meterological variables. I hope some time in future machine learning techniques would be fully employed in weather forecasting.

It currently includes,
1. Classify the month by looking at the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) map.
2. Idntify the Madden-Julian Oscillation's (MJO) phase by using OLR and wind data.
3. Detecting Cyclone using Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

Some of the problems currently under development include,
1. Time series forecasting of MJO indexes.
2. Detecting the droughts by various indices.
and many more to follow...
