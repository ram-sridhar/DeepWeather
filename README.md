### Predicting weather by machine learning

Machine learning is turning out to be a powerful learning technique across various domains today. This is a small attempt in applying machine learning in the field of meteorology. I have applied different methods to forecast various meterological variables. I hope some time in future machine learning techniques would be fully employed in weather forecasting.

It currently includes,
1. Idntify the Madden-Julian Oscillation's (MJO) phase by using OLR and wind data.
2. Detecting Cyclone using Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
3. Time series prediction of Monsoon by RNN and SARIMA model.
4. Classify the month by looking at the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) map.
5. Retrieving winds from the vorticity and divergence fields

Some of the problems currently under development include,
1. Time series forecasting of MJO indexes.
2. Detecting the droughts by various indices.
and many more to follow...
